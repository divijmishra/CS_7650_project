NLP_Project.ipynb contains our code for the final project, which we ran on Google Colab on a T4 GPU.
The dataset we use is available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ade_corpus_v2. 
The Jupyter notebook downloads the dataset automatically using HF APIs, so we don't provide the data explictly.
