This repo contains the submission for our group project for CS7650: Natural Language Processing, in which we fine-tuned BERT variants for classification and NER tasks to identify adverse drug reactions. 

You can find our final report and presentation slides in the repo, while our presentation is available at https://youtu.be/hSPoN_zBxYY.

NLP_Project.ipynb contains our code for the final project, which we ran on Google Colab on a T4 GPU.

The dataset we use is available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ade_corpus_v2.
